VARIABLES IN C
Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. They must be declared before use, specifying the data type. 
IF STATEMENT
Is a conditional statement. It allows one to control whether a program enters a section of code or not based on whether a given condition is true or false. If statements allow the flow of the program to be changed.

ELSE STATEMENT
Is used to execute some code instead of the code executed when an if statement evaluates to true. Another use of else is when there are muliple conditional statements that may all evaluate to true yet you want only one if statement body to execute.

WHILE LOOP
It is used for repeated execution of a block of code while a condition is true.
