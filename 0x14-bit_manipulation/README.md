0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Done by Alpha Omollo

Bit manipulation is a powerful technique in programming that involves manipulating individual bits within a data value. It is particularly useful for tasks like setting, clearing, toggling specific bits, and optimizing memory usage. This guide provides a brief overview of common bit manipulation operations in C.

Basic Bitwise Operators
1. AND (&)
Performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands. The result has a 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

2. OR (|)
Performs a bitwise OR operation between two operands. The result has a 1 if at least one corresponding bit is 1.

3. XOR (^)
Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two operands. The result has a 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

4. NOT (~)
Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand, flipping all the bits
