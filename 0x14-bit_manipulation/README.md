Introduction
Bit manipulation is a powerful technique in programming that involves manipulating individual bits within a data type. By directly manipulating bits, we can perform various operations efficiently, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking the state of specific bits. This documentation provides an overview of common bit manipulation techniques in C programming.

Bitwise Operators
C provides bitwise operators that allow us to manipulate individual bits within variables. The commonly used bitwise operators are:

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands. It sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.
OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two operands. It sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
XOR (^): Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between two operands. It sets each bit to 1 if exactly one of the corresponding bits is 1.
NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand. It inverts each bit, changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions.
