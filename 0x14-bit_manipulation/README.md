0x14-bit manipulation
 Done by: Alpha Omollo

Bit manipulation in C involves the manipulation of individual bits within a data type. In C, data types such as integers, characters, and longs are represented using a series of bits, which are either 0 or 1.

Bit manipulation in C is useful when you want to perform operations such as setting or clearing individual bits, shifting bits to the left or right, or testing whether a specific bit is set or not. These operations can be performed using bitwise operators in C.
