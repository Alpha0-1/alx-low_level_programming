The malloc function in C is used to dynamically allocate a specified amount of memory during the execution of a program. It stands for "memory allocation." This memory is allocated from the heap, which is a region of the computer's memory reserved for dynamic allocation.

Parameters:

size_t size: The number of bytes to allocate.
Return Value:

On success: A pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory block.
On failure: NULL (indicating that the allocation request could not be fulfilled, often due to insufficient available memory).
Usage:
