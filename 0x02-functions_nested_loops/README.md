0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

In C programming, functions serve as modular units that encapsulate a set of instructions, promoting code reusability and maintainability. Functions are declared with a return type, a name, and optional parameters, and can be defined to perform specific tasks.

Nested loops in C refer to the practice of placing one loop inside another. This allows for the execution of a set of statements multiple times, with the inner loop executing its entire cycle for each iteration of the outer loop. This hierarchical structure enables the handling of complex repetitive tasks efficiently.

Functions and nested loops can be used together to create more structured and organized code. Functions encapsulate a specific functionality, and nested loops provide a means to iterate through data or perform repetitive tasks in a controlled manner. This combination enhances code readability and promotes the modular design of programs in the C programming language.
