A hash table in C is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. It uses a technique called hashing to map keys to indexes in an array, providing constant-time average case complexity for these operations, making it suitable for tasks requiring fast lookup. Hash tables consist of an array of slots, each capable of holding a key-value pair. The hash function computes a hash value from the key, which is used to determine the index where the corresponding value will be stored or retrieved. Collision handling mechanisms, such as chaining or open addressing, are employed to handle cases where multiple keys map to the same index.
